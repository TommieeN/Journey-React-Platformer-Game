## Journey #
Welcome to my platformer game project! This game was created using React, JavaScript, Node.js, Sass, Canvas API, Webpack and JSON. The map was created using an application called Tiled, which were exported as a JSON file for collision block data and as an image for the background. The objective of the game is to move the character with the arrow keys, avoid the flying enemies, and get to the other side to finish the level.

# Features #
Move the character with the arrow keys
Avoid flying enemies
Finish the level by reaching the other side

# Lessons Learned #
Throughout this project, I learned the importance of keeping code clean and tidy, as I continued to add more and more functions and classes it soon became apparent that my code was getting a lot more harder to maintain. There was also very scarce info on building games with react, if I had spent more time researching game engines created on Github, it probably would have been beneficial. Next steps for this project include adding combat, where the player can slay enemies, adding more levels, implementing a backend to store game data like leaderboards and levels, and making it mobile-friendly.
